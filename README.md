Hey, I am Konstantin "Kon" Kuzmin. I live in Austin, TX. I love developing new things, helping others learn new skills, and learning new skills myself. 
My main interest is data in all its forms, shapes, quantity, and quality and all the ways we can collect it, pivot, slice, aggregate or any other ways analyze to get insights.

Cheers!
~Kon
